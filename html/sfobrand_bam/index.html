    <h4>Simple, clear communications are a fundamental part of the promise of SFO's brand.  They are essential to communicate how SFO is a state-of-the-art airport, providing customers with one of the most innovative experiences in the world.<br /><br />
SFO's logo, signature, and typeface are three important tools we have for introducing our brand and identifying the airport in all future communications. The consistent use of these elements is crucial to building clear communications and brand awareness. The purpose of this Brand Asset Management System is to provide protocols that will help guide communications and marketing staff to use the logo, signature, and typeface in a consistent and effective manner.</h4>
