    <h1>Color</h1>
    <h2>Primary (Corporate) Color Palette</h2>
    <p>Color is a core element of any brand. It relies on the careful and consistent use of the defined colors. The MeasureOne corporate color palette consists of MeasureOne Red, MeasureOne Dark Gray, MeasureOne Light Gray, Black, and White. White backgrounds are preferred for logo placement, but other options are provided below. Black may also be used for text.</p>
    <p>For commercial printing, PantoneÂ® (PMS) inks are recommended. For 4-color process printing, use the specified CMYK color values. Apply the RGB or HTML color models for screen/web.</p>
    <p>Never alter the provided logo art or colors. Use the version of the logo for its intended application/print outcome. </p>

    <h2>Secondary Color Palette</h2>
    <p>Using a consistent set of colors helps to create brand recognition. In addition to the corporate colors, there are a wide range of colors that can be used to create different expressions of the brand and to potentially color code.</p>
    <p>The primary and secondary colors can be used in various combinations. The majority of the colors work well together, although some may clash with one another (like Orange and Blue). Try to use color combinations that complement each other. Limit the prominent use of different colors on a single layout to four. This will prevent designs from becoming busy or overwhelming to the viewer.</p>
    <h3>Secondary Colors</h3>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The preferred use of the logo is on a white background. Other backgrounds that the full-color logo can be used with are tints of no greater than 30 percent of MeasureOne Light Gray, 20 percent of MeasureOne Dark Gray, or 15 percent of black. The reversed color logo can be used with MeasureOne Dark Gray, MeasureOne Dark Red or black. As a general rule, provide sufficient contrast between the background and logo so that the logo is clearly legible.</p>
