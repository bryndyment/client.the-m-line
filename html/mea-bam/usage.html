    <h1>Logo Usage</h1>
    <h2>Clear Space</h2>
    <p>Maintaining an area around the logos, known as clear space, will ensure the logos stand out from the other elements such as text, photography and other logos. Determine the clear space by measuring the height of the M character in the MeasureOne wordmark element and then applying this distance to all sides of the logo.</p>

    <h2>Minimum Size</h2>
    <p>To avoid compromising the legibility and overall quality of the MeasureOne logo, adhere to the minimum size requirements. When resizing the logo, ensure that both the logomark and the wordmark are resized together so their proportion to each other remains constant.<br />
      The minimum size is determined by the width of the logo. For screen use, the width should be a minimum of 80 pixels. For print use, the width should be a minimum of 0.5‚Äù.</p>

    <h2>Inappropriate Uses of the Logo</h2>
    <p>All elements of the MeasureOne logo have been designed with careful consideration. Do not alter or recreate the logo artwork in any way. Doing so may dilute the integrity of the brand. Inappropriate ways to alter the logo can include (and are not limited to) the examples shown below. Always request/use the official logo artwork when creating MeasureOne communications.</p>
